= jQuery Infinite Scroll

A basic infinite scrolling pattern for jQuery.

== Getting Started

=== Usage

==== Basic

 $(window).infinitescroll({url: window.location.href});

==== A little more customized

 $(window).infinitescroll({
    url: window.location.href,
    triggerAt: 150,
    page: 4,
    appendTo: 'table.userlist tbody'
 });



=== Patterns

==== How can I specify which page of data to load?

The "page" query parameter is appended to the URL specified

==== How to tell this plugin there's no more data/pages to load?

This is determined by handing back an empty response from the server. Once this happens, this plugin stops attempting to load data.

=== Options

 url:
    default: null
    The URL to fetch more data to append
 triggerAt:
    default: 300
    This is the number of pixels from the bottom of the container (defaults to "document") to trigger the fetch for data
 page:
    default: 2
    The page number to fetch (sets the page=# query parameter in the URL)
 appendTo:
    default: ".list tbody"
    The selector that .append() gets called on
 container:
    default: document
    This is the container used to measure scrolling, and then trigger a load
 fade:
    default: 'none'
    Speed at which new data will smoothly fade in after appending. eg 'fast', 'slow', 250, 1000 (numbers in milliseconds). Set to 'none' or 0 to have results appear without a fade. 

=== Events

==== That this plugin will fire

 infinitescroll.beforesend: Fired just before the ajax request is given
 infinitescroll.finish: Fired after a successful request has finished, and the data has been inserted into the DOM
 infinitescroll.maxreached: Fired after the first empty response from the server. This will disable any further loading of data.

==== That this plugin listens for

 infinitescroll.scrollpage: This can be used to force a full-cycle load of data and append much like what happens just after the 'infinitescroll.beforesend' event is fired.
    Note: The plugin is listening for this event to be fired on whatever DOM object you initially bound it to. This assumes one the examples above were used.
    Example: $(window).trigger('infinitescroll.scrollpage', 1);
